# [Full Stack open 2025](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)
This github repository contains my solutions of exercises for the Full Stack open. Throughout the repository I made an effort to treat each exercise as a commit based on the [rules](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) of the course.

## Course Introduction
This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.  
The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, the use of databases for storing the applicationâ€™s data amongst other things.
